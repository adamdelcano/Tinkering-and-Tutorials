MALEK NOTES

1000 coin debt to a noble Merchant of Gaunt. In a previous life I was tasked with delivering goods, but failed, and now I owe interest.

Odinthrike of Ninehold is spooky. Blank book in Ninehold possession.

Burrowing worms: stand still, ignore!

Scroll that causes a chime of opening
Scroll that cures disease
Scroll that makes earthquake


Northwest of Cave = Pagans

Long dwarf-hallway to northwest of Ninehold, LONG!!! ~1km. Very intense.

THE BULWARK: Steel grating with a lot of holes in it with a ton of spears and a catapult to just launch stuff in. Passages to North, Northwest, West. If you head through then it'll take you to lower caverns, then head north to Pagans. 

Went northwest. Now volcanic rock and only passage is to the north. In the distance it splits to north and to the west.
NORTH: Mantis lair
WEST: 200 feet to the west: cavern splits open, chanting from the north, west, and to the south dripping water.

North: Cult leader sacrificing snake and with twelve disciples. Another exit to the south.
West: 100 feet to, passageway to north and south, chanting to north.
South: water + pool, west and east


NAMES:
Ferrin: Pagan Warlord, skin man. "May your blood serve the great ox."
Balthazar -> trying to take over ninehold

Bull God follower, Ferrin has done a lot to improve the Bull God cult.
